# MP3 Test Vectors

## Recommended

### ID3v2.4 and ID3v2.3 TXXX Frames

This is the recommended format as specified in the
[Hydrogenaudio ReplayGain specification](http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=ReplayGain_specification#ID3v2) 
and the
[Hydrogenaudio Replaygain 2.0 specification](http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=ReplayGain_2.0_specification#ID3v2).
It matches the tag format generated by [Foobar2000](https://foobar2000.org/)
and most modern ReplayGain scanning tools.

#### Basic functionality

- `id3v24-txxx-track-only.mp3` and `id3v23-txxx-track-only.mp3`

  Files that have only track gain and peak present. They should play at the
  reference level regardless of whether the player is in track or album mode.
  If no gain is applied, they will play back too quietly.

- `id3v24-txxx-track.mp3` and `id3v23-txxx-track.mp3`

  Files for testing the application's track mode setting. These should play at
  the reference level if the player is in track mode. They will play too
  quietly if the album gain is used, and too loud if no gain is applied.

## Optional

### APEv2 Tags

Some applications, such as the `mp3gain` command line tool (by default, at
least), store the calculated gain information in an APEv2 tag. The format used
is the same as used in VorbisComment-style tags.

#### Basic functionality

- `apev2-track-only.mp3`

  File that has only APEv2 format track gain and peak present. It should play
  at the reference level regardless of whether the player is in track or album
  mode. If the gain is not applied, the playback will be too quiet.

#### Tag conflicts

The APEv2 tags can be present on an MP3 file in addition to ID3 tags of
various types. If both are present with conflicting values, the recommended
format should be preferred.

- `apev2-track-prefer-id3-txxx.mp3`

  A file with conflicting APEv2 and ID3v2 TXXX ReplayGain tags. Use in track
  gain mode. If the preferred ID3 TXXX tag is used, the file will play back at
  the reference level. Instead, if the APEv2 tag is used, the file will play
  back too quietly. In album gain mode, or if neither tag is used, the file
  will play back too loud.
