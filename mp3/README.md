# MP3 Test Vectors

## Recommended

### ID3v2.4 and ID3v2.3 TXXX Frames

This is the recommended format as specified in the
[Hydrogenaudio ReplayGain specification](http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=ReplayGain_specification#ID3v2) 
and the
[Hydrogenaudio Replaygain 2.0 specification](http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=ReplayGain_2.0_specification#ID3v2).
It matches the tag format generated by [Foobar2000](https://foobar2000.org/)
and most modern ReplayGain scanning tools.

#### Basic functionality

- `id3v24-txxx-track-only.mp3` and `id3v23-txxx-track-only.mp3`

  Files that have only track gain and peak present. They should play at the
  reference level regardless of whether the player is in track or album mode.
  If no gain is applied, they will play back too quietly.

- `id3v24-txxx-track.mp3` and `id3v23-txxx-track.mp3`

  Files for testing the application's track mode setting. These should play at
  the reference level if the player is in track mode. They will play too
  quietly if the album gain is used, and too loud if no gain is applied.
